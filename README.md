# Education DAO

**Education DAO** is a blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate community-driven decision-making for updating educational curricula. This project leverages decentralized governance to ensure a transparent and democratic process for curriculum development involving educators, students, and industry experts.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized and inclusive education system where curriculum updates are decided by a community of stakeholders. By utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and adaptability in the educational landscape, aligning it more closely with the needs of learners and the evolving job market.
